# Example using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python Libraries

This solution assumes that a cluster has already been initialized and ready for use. 
- Useful for notebook-scoped dependencies for classic and serverless compute
- List of libraries used in example code are for illustrative purposes -- please check that you have the adequate licenses to install required libraries for your use-case(s).
- Installed libraries/dependencies will persist only session-based, unless an `init.sh` script is used to pre-install `wheel` path (e.g. UC Vols) and `symlink` to `.ipython` profile path. (Please refer to the approach described on `main` branch)
